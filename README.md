## 🌟 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **Real-Time AI Image Description System** using a webcam. The AI model observes the live camera feed and **describes what it sees in real-time**. The descriptions are both printed on the screen and read aloud using text-to-speech.  

It leverages:  
- **OpenCV** for webcam video capture  
- **Google Gemini AI (via API)** to generate textual descriptions of images  
- **pyttsx3** for real-time audio narration  
- Requires an **API key** and **internet connection** for AI processing  

This project is ideal for:  
- Real-time object recognition demonstrations  
- Assistive technology for visually impaired users  
- Educational purposes to showcase AI perception

## ⚡ Features

- 🎥 **Real-time webcam analysis** – Processes frames continuously from a live camera feed  
- 📝 **AI-generated descriptions** – Uses Google Gemini AI to describe the current scene  
- 🔊 **Text-to-Speech narration** – Reads the descriptions aloud using `pyttsx3`  
- 💻 **User-friendly interface** – Shows webcam feed with instructions to quit (`q` key)  
- ⚡ **Optimized performance** – Adjusted resolution and frame rate to reduce lag  
- 🌐 **API-based AI processing** – Generates intelligent, context-aware descriptions

## 🔍 Scope of the Project

This project demonstrates **how AI models perceive and describe visual input in real-time**. It can be extended in several ways:

- Integration with **assistive devices** for visually impaired users  
- Adding **object tracking** or highlighting detected items in the video feed  
- Using multiple **AI models** for more accurate or detailed scene descriptions  
- Recording and storing the descriptions for **video or surveillance analysis**  
- Adding **vo**
